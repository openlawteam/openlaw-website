# Dynamic, Next Generation Legal Agreements

## Contracts Are Changing
It is now possible to model all or parts of legal agreements using code (smart contracts), decreasing the cost and friction of creating, securing, and generating binding legal agreements.

## No Comprehensive Tool
Lawyers lack basic tools to build these dynamic, smart contracts in a way that is enforceable and understandable to a legal professional.
