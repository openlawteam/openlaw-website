# Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: May 22, 2018

Your privacy is important to us. Consensys, Inc. (&ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) is committed to protecting the privacy, confidentiality, and security of your information by complying with the requirements under applicable laws and regulations. We are committed to ensuring that all our employees, service providers, and agents uphold these obligations.

This privacy policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) governs data collection and usage of the services, software, platform, and websites provided by OpenLaw (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and any of our affiliates (collectively, &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). By using the Services, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy as well as our [Terms of Use](/terms). If you do not agree to any part of this Privacy Policy, then you should stop accessing the Services immediately.

Your privacy is important to us. When running OpenLaw, we follow a few fundamental principles:

*   We don’t ask you for Personally Identifiable Information (defined below) unless we truly need it. That being said, the information we do ask for is solely to enable us to build an amazing customized experience and to communicate with you.
*   We don’t share your information with third parties except to deliver you the Site, comply with the law, make OpenLaw better, protect our rights, and/or effectuate a business transfer.
*   We’re not a huge, faceless corporation. We’re just normal people trying to deliver an incredible experience. If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please reach out to us at [hello@openlaw.io](mailto:hello@openlaw.io).

## How You Accept This Privacy Policy

By using OpenLaw, creating a user account, or creating/viewing a template or agreement on the Site you agree to the use, disclosure, and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## What Information Does OpenLaw Collect?

The information we collect from you falls into two categories: (i) personally identifiable information (i.e., data that could potentially identify you as an individual) (&ldquo;Personally Identifiable Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;PII&rdquo;), and (ii) non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you ) (&ldquo;Non-Personally Identifiable Information&rdquo; or &ldquo;Non-PII&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy covers both categories and will tell you how we might collect and use each type.

We may collect a variety of PII, including:

*   Information from Third Party Services (defined below) that you explicitly give us access to; and
*   Your contact information, such as your email address (depending on how you contact us).

We may also collect a variety of Non-PII, including various analytics data, such as:

*   the IP address of the computer you use to access OpenLaw;
*   the type of browser software you are using;
*   the operating system you are using;
*   the date and time you access or use OpenLaw;
*   the website address, if any, that linked you to OpenLaw;
*   the website address, if any, you leave our website and travel to;
*   other non-personally identifiable traffic data;
*   versions of the OpenLaw operating system and browser; and
*   any username, including your first and last name, you submit to associate with your account on OpenLaw.

## How We Collect Information

### When You Create an Account or Provide Us with Information to Join or Sign an Agreement Using OpenLaw

If you create an account or use the services provided by OpenLaw, we may request certain PII. This may include contact information such as your full name, organization, email address, phone number, billing address and account login information. In addition, we may collect information regarding other accounts you choose to link with OpenLaw (e.g., Metamask, Google, etc.).

We, or companies that provide services on our behalf, may also collect certain financial information from you, such as your payment method (which may include a valid credit card number, type, expiration date, or other financial information). By making a purchase through OpenLaw, you give us consent to use and provide your financial information as we consider necessary to process the transaction.

### Information We Automatically Collect

At OpenLaw, we use cookies to help identify and track usage of the Site and to make it easier to deliver a personalized experience. You can easily refuse our cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser. However, be forewarned that disabling cookies may cause OpenLaw not to operate properly.

In order to improve and grow OpenLaw, we also use analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to automatically collect information about user and visitor usage (collectively, &ldquo;Analytics Tools&rdquo;). These Analytics Tools collect data such as how often you visit OpenLaw, what areas of the Site you visit, and what other sites or services you used prior to using OpenLaw.

Analytics Tools generally operate differently. For example, Google Analytics only collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit OpenLaw, not your name or other identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your computer to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. As of right now, we only use the information we get from Analytics Tools to improve OpenLaw and do not combine the information collected through the use of Analytics Tools with PII. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future.

### Third Party Services

To run OpenLaw, we often utilize various third-party products (collectively, &ldquo;Third Party Services&rdquo;), such as Google or Metamask. If you authorize us to connect with these Third Party Services, you grant us permission to collect certain PII, such as your full name, email address, phone number, and any other information that the Third Party Service makes available to us. Please note that your use of these Third Party Services is governed by their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We use and disclose any collected information in accordance with our own Privacy Policy.

### Communications You Initiate with Us

We do everything possible to make sure you have an amazing experience when using OpenLaw. If you contact us in person, by phone, email, instant message, live chat, or by some other means (either through our Site or through a Third Party Service), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence for later reference (to help improve our Site!).

## How We Use the Information We Gather

We primarily use the information we collect and store to enhance OpenLaw. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your personal information.

### Use of Information to Provide OpenLaw to You

We use personal information to create an awesome experience. Some ways we may internally use your information are to:

*   Contact you when necessary;
*   Facilitate the signing and execution of agreements via OpenLawt;
*   Respond to your comments or questions;
*   Provide you with additional information according to your preferences;
*   Customize and personalize your OpenLaw experience;
*   Generate aggregated statistics to help us improve the customer experience;
*   Make OpenLaw easier and more convenient for you (such as by pre-populating forms when you have already provided identical information);
*   Provide recommendations to you;
*   Send you information and marketing materials about services and products available on our Site;
*   Train our team members; or
*   Other internal business purposes.

### Agents or Third Party Partners

We may provide your personal information to our employees, contractors, agents, service providers, and designees (collectively, &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;) to enable them to perform certain services for us exclusively, including:

*   Website-related services such as web hosting;
*   Improvement of website-related services and features;
*   Maintenance services; or
*   Distribution of advertisements and other marketing materials on our behalf.

### Business Transfers

We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, your personal information could be one of the assets transferred to, or acquired by, a third party. By accepting this Privacy Policy, as outlined above, you consent to any such transfer.

### Protection of Us and Others

We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to: comply with the law or a court order; cooperate with law enforcement; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](/terms) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OpenLaw, our employees, our users, or others.

We may disclose your PII as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request.

## What Personal Information Can I Access or Change?

Once you sign up for an account, we provide you with various options that enable you to delete or revise your personal information. You can change, alter, or amend personal information that you provide to us by visiting your account settings at www.openlaw.io. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at any time at [hello@openlaw.io](mailto:hello@openlaw.io).

## Unsubscribe

If you decide you don’t want to receive email or other mail from us, you can select the &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; provision in our communications or in your profile settings to unsubscribe. Unsubscribing will stop you from receiving most types of communication, but it may not apply to emails about orders or transactions you place through the Site or to respond to your specific request.

## Attorney Communication

If you choose to communicate with an attorney through our Services, please note that any such communications between you and such attorney may not necessarily be treated as confidential information by the attorney or protected by the attorney-client privilege doctrine. For additional information, please read the &ldquo;Overview&rdquo; section in our [Terms of Use](/terms).

## Data Retention

If you delete your account or request that your information be deleted, we still may retain some personal information that you have provided to us in order to maintain OpenLaw or to comply with relevant laws.

## Data Security

We are committed to making sure your information is protected and have selected third-party vendors, including Stripe and Metamask, that help keep your personal information safe. Unfortunately, we do not control these third parties and therefore cannot guarantee complete security.

We do employ several physical and electronic safeguards to keep your information safe, including encrypted user passwords and securing all connections with industry standard transport layer security.

If you log into your account on a shared computer, be sure to sign out of your account when finished. If you believe a third party has access to your account, you must let us know as soon as possible.

Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.

## Children

We’re not a site targeted towards children, and we don’t knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen (13). If you become aware that a child has provided us with PII, please contact us as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using OpenLaw on behalf of your minor child as PII as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.

If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has used OpenLaw, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at [hello@openlaw.io](mailto:hello@openlaw.io).

## Online Tracking and How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (e.g., Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including OpenLaw, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit [http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com).

## We Reserve the Right to Update and Revise This Privacy Policy at Any Time

We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo; at the top of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit and will do our best to notify you if there are material changes. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms. Any use of OpenLaw after an amendment to our Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance to the revised or amended agreement.

Please be aware that your personal data will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those in your country of residence. You consent to the transfer of your information, including personal information, to the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Policy by visiting our site or using our service.

Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA to the U.S. or countries not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal information protection, the transfer will be based on a data transfer mechanism recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal information.

**COOKIES POLICY**

We understand that your privacy is important to you and are committed to being transparent about the technologies we use. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies on our Site.

**Do we use Cookies?**

Yes. We and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers use cookies, web beacons, or pixels and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses the Site has the best possible experience.

**What is a Cookie?**

A cookie (&ldquo;Cookie&rdquo;) is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below. We update this list periodically, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Site or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.

**Why do we use Cookies?**

We generally use Cookies for the following purposes:

*   To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
*   To better understand the interests of our customers and our website visitors.

Some Cookies are necessary for certain uses of the Site, and without such Cookies, we would not be able to provide many services that you need to properly use the Site. These Cookies, for example, allow us to operate our Site so you may access it as you have requested and let us recognize that you have created an account and have logged into that account to access Site content. They also include Cookies that enable us to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session and secure our Sites.

We also use functional Cookies and Cookies from third parties for analysis and marketing purposes. Functional Cookies enable certain parts of the site to work properly and your user preferences to remain known. Analysis Cookies, among other things, collect information on how visitors use our Site, the content and products that users view most frequently, and the effectiveness of our third party advertising. Advertising Cookies assist in delivering ads to relevant audiences and having our ads appear at the top of search results. Cookies are either &ldquo;session&rdquo; Cookies which are deleted when you end your browser session, or &ldquo;persistent,&rdquo; which remain until their deletion by you (discussed below) or the party who served the cookie. Full details on all of the Cookies used on the Site are available at our Cookie Disclosure table below.
