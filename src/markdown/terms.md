# Terms of Use

## Effective Date: March 23, 2018

Welcome to OpenLaw! Please read these Terms of Use (the “Agreement” or “Terms”) carefully, along with any other policies or notices and our Privacy Policy (defined below) located at [openlaw.io/privacy](https://openlaw.io/privacy), as they lay out the rules, terms, and guidelines for you to follow when using and accessing our website [openlaw.io](https://openlaw.io/) (“OpenLaw” or the “Site”) (collectively, the “Services”). This Agreement governs your use of OpenLaw and constitutes a legally binding agreement between each user (“you,” “your,” or “User”) and Consensys, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”).

By using OpenLaw, you agree to follow and be bound by these Terms and agree to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not access OpenLaw.

We may revise these Terms at any time without notice to you. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at [hello@openlaw.io](mailto:hello@openlaw.io).

In order to use OpenLaw you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (“Account”). You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account, unless a specific Service permits otherwise.

## Overview

We know terms and conditions can be long, confusing, and full of legalese, so we will do our best to keep things as clear and concise as possible. This section is a brief summary of the highlights of this Agreement. Know that when you accept this Agreement, you are accepting all of our Terms and not just this section. Simply by using OpenLaw, including browsing the Site, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully. Grab a pair of glasses if you need to.

OpenLaw is an online legal contracts portal which provides users with a blockchain-based protocol for an automated solution for individuals and entities who choose to prepare legal documents. OpenLaw hosts blockchain software as a backend service for customers who create their own legal documents. You can use the OpenLaw platform to create smart contracts, add information to blockchain using cryptocurrency (ETH), and other actions permitted by these Terms.

At no time do we, or will we, review your content or agreements for legal sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, or provide legal advice, opinions, or recommendations about your legal rights, remedies, defenses, options, selection of forms, or strategies. OpenLaw is not a law firm and may not perform services performed by an attorney. Please note that any communications between you and OpenLaw are not protected as confidential information under the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. OPENLAW, ITS SERVICES, AND ITS FORMS OR TEMPLATES ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE ADVICE OR SERVICES OF AN ATTORNEY.

OpenLaw attempts to keep its legal documents accurate and up-to-date. However, because the law changes rapidly, OpenLaw cannot guarantee that all of the information is completely current. The law differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may be subject to interpretation by different courts. The law is a personal matter, and no general information or legal tool like the kind OpenLaw provides can accommodate all circumstances.

The legal information contained on OpenLaw and the Service does not constitute legal advice and is not guaranteed to be correct, complete, or up-to-date. Therefore, if you need legal advice for your specific problem, or if your specific problem is too complex to be addressed by our tools, you should consult a licensed attorney in your area. AGREEMENTS OR CONTRACTS PROVIDED BY OPENLAW ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR LEGAL ADVICE FROM A QUALIFIED ATTORNEY LICENSED TO PRACTICE IN AN APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION.

These Terms outline approved uses of OpenLaw, various licenses we grant to you, and the licenses you grant to us. We take our commitment to customer service seriously and will work with you to make sure you are happy with your programming challenges.

## How You Accept These Terms

By accessing or using OpenLaw in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms, as well as the accompanying privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), which is accessible at [openlaw.io/privacy](https://openlaw.io/privacy).

Note that we reserve the right to modify the Terms at any time in our sole discretion. Any changes to the Terms will be posted on our website at [openlaw.io.com/terms](https://openlaw.io/terms) and will become effective immediately upon posting. It is your responsibility to check for updates to this Agreement periodically.

If the changes are significant, we will do our best to notify you via email or through a notification. Please check the effective date above to determine if there have been any changes since you last reviewed these Terms.

If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should not use OpenLaw. Your continued use of OpenLaw after any amendment or modification to the Agreement constitutes your consent to the amended or modified Agreement.

## Eligibility

You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than eighteen (18) years of age), to use our Services. If you are under eighteen (18) years old and would like to use OpenLaw, you can, but only if a parent or legal guardian who is at least eighteen (18) years old supervises you. In all cases, such adult will be considered the User and is responsible for any and all activity on your Account.

You can only use OpenLaw to the extent the laws of your jurisdiction or the United States do not bar you from doing so. Please make sure these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you.

By using OpenLaw, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements we outline in these Terms. We may still refuse to let certain people access or use our Services. We may also change our eligibility criteria at any time.

We offer our Services only for personal, non-commercial use and not for the use or benefit of any third party (unless you are a parent or legal guardian using our Services for your minor child).

## Your Account With OpenLaw

You will need to create an Account with OpenLaw in order to download, upload, edit, send, or execute any agreement made available on the Site. In order to create an Account, you will need to provide us with your your full name, organization, email address, phone number, billing address and account login information. In addition, we may collect information regarding other accounts you choose to link with OpenLaw (e.g., Metamask, Google, etc.).

By creating an Account, here are a few common sense rules and acknowledgements that we ask you comply with and understand:

**Be honest with us**. Provide accurate information about yourself. It’s not OK to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your Account. Any failure to provide complete and accurate information can lead to the immediate termination of your Account -- and we don’t want to do that!

**You’re responsible for your Account**. You’re solely responsible for any activity on your Account. If you’re sharing an Account with other people (e.g., if you’re representing a business entity), then you will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you’re registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Your Account is not transferable. You are solely responsible for any activity on your Account, so it’s important to keep your Account password secure. In case of a dispute over the identity of the user, the authorized account holder of the OpenLaw account will be deemed to be the user. “Authorized account holder” of an account is defined as the natural person assigned to the email address associated with the Account.

**Be clear about our relationship**. Creating an account with OpenLaw, or using our Site or Services, does not create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, attorney-client, or franchisee relationship with us. No confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created with us other than pursuant to these Terms.

**Passwords**. You’re responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access OpenLaw and for any activities or actions under your password -- that means no sharing with third parties either. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords with your Account. Your password must be at least eight (8) characters long.

**Emails**. By creating an Account, you agree that you may receive communications from OpenLaw, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates. You also understand that you can remove yourself from these communications by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the footer of the actual emails.

**Impersonation**. If someone has created an account in which he or she pretends to be you, and you send us a request to take down that account, please be sure that you have included the email address of the fake account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify us upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use of your password or Account or any other breach of security; and, (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session when using OpenLaw.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section of the Terms.

Please contact [hello@openlaw.io](mailto:hello@openlaw.io) if you have any questions about registering your Account with OpenLaw.

**Provide Us with Feedback**. Your feedback can help us improve your experience and our Services. Any unsolicited ideas or other materials you submit to OpenLaw (and are not including your User Content (defined below)) are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation, credit, or acknowledgement.

**Operation of Smart Contracts**. OpenLaw smart contracts will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them.Therefore, any failure or malfunctioning of the Ethereum protocol may renderOpenLaw temporarily inoperable.

Smart contracts are a new and relatively untested technology. In addition to the risks mentioned in these Terms, there are certain additional risks that the OpenLaw platform cannot foresee. OpenLaw is not responsible for the execution of smart contracts. These risks may manifest themselves in other forms of risk than those specified herein. By using OpenLaw, you acknowledge and agree that OpenLaw is not responsible for the operation of the underlying protocols and that OpenLaw makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability. You acknowledge and agree that OpenLaw assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever with respect to any cryptocurrency loss or smart contract malfunction/mistake.

**Use of Cryptocurrency**. You represent and warrant that any cryptocurrency transfer that you make through OpenLaw is legal in your jurisdiction. We will not be held liable for any loss or damages due to your non-compliance. All cryptocurrency transfers are made voluntarily and at your sole discretion, and you realize all risks of using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, which are generally understood and recognized in accordance with the warnings of the financial regulators of countries across the world, as well as the risks specified in this Agreement. OpenLaw is not responsible for any cryptocurrency that may be lost through the process of smart contract execution.

Any use of OpenLaw other than as specifically authorized in this Agreement, without our prior written permission, is strictly prohibited and will terminate your license to use OpenLaw.

## Assignment

You agree that we may assign any of our rights and/or transfer, sub-contract, or delegate any of our obligations under these Terms. Your agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any third party.

## Entire Agreement

This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of this Agreement) and every nature between us.
